# Aqua-Doctor
decompiled from Aqua-Doctor.jar a.k.a Heatmaster2 (~2011)
This software (by Rollmann Elektronik) is created to be used with Alphacool Heatmaster 2 monitoring hardware. Originally utilized Javacomm API/RXTX (early version) to communicate with the virtual serial port (SiliconLabs CP210X USB to UART Bridge). Supports also the planned Ethernet connection. The software seems to have been abandoned and no longer updated (distributed with Version 6 of JRE).
